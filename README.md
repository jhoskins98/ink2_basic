Inkplate2 basic setup for Platform IO

This is a barebones attempt to get the ardunio version of the basic Inkplate2 working 

Using https://github.com/martinberlin/inkplate-platformio and examples/1. Basic Inkplate Functionality/1-Inkplate_basic_monochrome/1-Inkplate_basic_monochrome.cpp



Looked at https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Inkplate-Platformio-Library/blob/main/README.md but it does not show Inkplate2 in the list 

So using https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Inkplate-Arduino-library 

Source for the code was https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Inkplate-Arduino-library/examples/Inkplate2/Basic/Inkplate2_Black_White_Red/Inkplate2_Black_White_Red.ino


Also where are the forums?

Also why is the www.inkplate.io web site not responding?
